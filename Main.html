                        Very few had this team on their list of potential elite 8 competitors, but here the Florida Atlantic Owls are, no longer flying under any radars.
                        The indicators were there: conference title, dominant regular season, conference tournament much of the same; however, with a great opening round win against Memphis
                        and a more favorable pairing of Fairleigh Dickinson in the round of 32, these owls prevailed to the sweet sixteen. In a close affair with the Vols, they came out on top
                        and advanced to the Elite 8 where they will face a possibly drained Kansas State team following one of the more remarkable games in recent memory against the Spartans.
                        Kansas State has undoubtedly the two best players on the court, the Owls will have to figure out a way to stop the 2 future NBA players if they want to complete the upset. 
                        This team will look to shock the world and head to the final 4 where there are no top 4 seeds until the National title game.

                        Learn the Name. Markquis Nowell. Alongside Keyonte Johnson, he is the catalyst of the best 1-2 combo remaining in the tournament.
                        Nowell takes the hardwood again tonight coming off the best performance by a Wildcat in the Ncaa tournament with 20 points and NCAA tournament record of 19(!) assists.
                        The Wildcats came into the tournament with controversial 3 seed bid in a predictably wild region with purdue as its top seed, and 
                        out of the bottom half of the region, they prevailed through a solid win against Montana State, then a grueling matchup against blue-blood
                        Kentucky where they halted Coach Calipari's season in the round of 32.
                        Kansas State has the top-end talent to compete with any of the remaining teams left in the tournament, but can this team gear up for another intense
                        matchup after playing in one of the biggest thrillers in recent tournament history? If they can make it past this fisty FAU squad, don't be surprised to see
                        this team hoisting the trophy in Houston.
